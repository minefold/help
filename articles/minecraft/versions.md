# Minecraft Versions

You need a paid copy of Minecraft for the PC or Mac before you can play on Minefold servers. You can buy it from http://minecraft.net/store.

You can't play multiplayer with the demo versions of Minecraft.

We don't permit Minefold servers to be craked or run in offline mode. If you enjoy playing Minecraft please considering [paying for it](http://minecraft.net/store).
