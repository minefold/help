# "End of Stream" Errors

There are a lots of causes of “end of stream” errors like running a modified client or a pre-release version of Minecraft. A good test is to see if you can connect to another (non-Minefold) server like `mc-lc.com`. If you can't then the problem is likely with your client. If you can connect to other servers please contact support.
